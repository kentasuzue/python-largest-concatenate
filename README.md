# python-largest_concatenate
This python program solves the problem at http://dm.compsciclub.ru/app/quiz-largest-number
The goal is to create the largest number by concatenating the given numbers. The given numbers are of varying digit length. There is a  complication when comparing two numbers with differing digit lengths. All of the leading digits of the longer number might match all the digits of the shorter number.  In this case, the shorter number temporarily has digits added to the tail, where the added digits come from the matching digits at the heads of the numbers.
